You can add, modify and delete any part of the code as long as you motivate your choice by adding **proper comments** to the page! You will find the full explanation on how this works directly inside [index.html](https://gitlab.com/phd-torino-physics/jc-homepage/blob/master/index.html) (the PHP version is not commented yet since it will not work here and you can find it here just for reference).

Clearly you can also signal bugs and more opening issues and bug reports and we will look at them as soon as we can!

Here you can find some inspiration from where to start:

- there are some incompatibility issues with Chrome and Bootstrap
- we need a fancier user interface
- we might be interested in having an administrator interface as well
- we might also integrate some sort of mailing list
- we should recode the title of the page because it is ugly
- we should find and include a new icon
- larger project: rewrite the lazy load function and the whole CSS/JS in order to have something completely written by us
