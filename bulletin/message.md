# Restyling!

After the first preview our new web page underwent a huge restyling by
**Michael** who wrote from scratch the CSS style file and some Javascripts.
This way we should be able to overcome possible issues with the display on
Google Chrome.

You can still find all the **previous content**, such as scheduled talks, calendar
and abstracts (with LaTeX support, using [Mathjax](https://www.mathjax.org/)).
You can also install the **web app** simply by choosing _"Add to your homescreen"_ on
your device: the page will behave as a **standalone app**.

The app can be used **offline** as well, allowing to see the updated schedule.
If cannot find the newest version of the talks, simply reload the page.

We wish you all the best.
